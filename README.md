### 🚀 Projects

Here are a few projects that showcase my skills:

- [🧩 Deep Code Reviewer – VS Code Extension](https://github.com/anumitad/vscode_extension_code_reviewer)  
A custom VS Code extension that uses machine learning to provide contextual code review suggestions. Built with TypeScript and integrates with a Python backend for analysis and ML inference. Focused on improving code quality and developer productivity.

- [🏋️ FitFind – Fitness & Knowledge Tracker Platform](https://github.com/anumitad/fit-find)  
An integrated platform to log workouts, track body metrics, and organize personal media using semantic search. Combines vector-based storage with Qdrant and LLM-powered Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable intelligent natural language querying of notes, videos, and audio. Visualizes fitness progress with time series modeling, powered by a FastAPI backend, Streamlit frontend, and Terraform-provisioned Oracle Autonomous Database.

- [🎨 Style Transfer with GANs](https://github.com/anumitad/monet_style_transfer)  
A deep learning project implementing a Generative Adversarial Network for artistic style transfer. Uses PyTorch with custom training loops, loss functions, and image augmentation. Includes results visualization and hyperparameter tuning experiments.
